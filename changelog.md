## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.1] - 2021-02-04

### Added
- Parser for Components -> Parameters
  - The parameters are added in a new store and are "copied" when are needed in the models or responses.
- Added `$ref` support in the `Components`
  - As the [standard specifies](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/
), it will COPY the referenced `$ref` object only changing the `model name`, so the other attributes are ignored.

### Fixed
- `copy-pluggable-files` command was broken, so templates were not copied to dist folder
- Debugger tasks which call `copy-pluggable-files`

## [2.5.0] - 2021-01-23 (MOCK GENERATOR BETA)
> This change add some beta features (but are stable).

### Added
- Engine to generate a `mock server` (the task is done after write all files).
- `json-server` for the `mock engine` (beta).
- Method to resolve "pluggable" elements (`resolvePluggablePath`).

### Changes
- Core template paths (default templates) are moved inside `src` to be coherent with the `mock engine` and also add native support for TS (future versions).
- The "pluggable" folders now are coppied to the `build` folder to be published within the package, otherwise the `templates` will be ignored from this version and also the `mock assets`.
- Specify `template` (and `output-folder`) is now **optional**, so you can create `mocks` without generate all files.
  - Also you can simply launch this script to check if the `json/yaml` document is "well formed" (compatible with the script, there are some missing OpenAPI 3 features not added yet).
- Now `build` folder is empty before each compilation.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-01-18
> This can break your `angular 2` app, now all APIs require a model instance.
> Also returns an instance, this can be a big break change, please test your app after build (in another branch) and fix all manually.

### Added
- Support for https remote files
- Added **but not used** [swagger2openapi](https://github.com/Mermade/oas-kit/) to future validations (and first method to convert Swagger 2 to OpenAPI V3 with this library)
